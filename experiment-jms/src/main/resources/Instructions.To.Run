Note: Both the producer and consumer are configured to utilize the same queue.   
1. Run the producer-app first to post the messages to the queue hosted by 'ActiveMQ'. 
2. Run the consumer-app to consume the messages posted by the producer-app (StudentProducerApp) from the queue hosted by 'ActiveMQ'.
